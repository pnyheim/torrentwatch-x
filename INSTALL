Dependencies
************

- Transmission (Tested with 1.7x)

- Working MTA if you wan't to get warnings and errors by mail.

Installation Instructions
*************************

- Copy all files to a directory where you webserver can read them.
- copy $docroot/php/config.php.dist to docroot/php/config.php and open it.
  Then set the "$basedir" variable to this directory.
- Configure your webserver so it points to the directory you used for torrentwatch-x.
- Create a directory '/etc/torrentwatch' and make sure the webserver can write there. 
  Or edit config.php and change the location to your wishes, beware to keep the config file out of the webroot as it holds the torrent clients password.
- Make sure the webserver can write to the following files and directories:
	- $docroot/rss_cache/
	- If you will be using the "deep directories" option the default download directory should be writable as well.
- Create a cron-entry for the user running the webserver for periodically checking for new torrents. Every 15 minutes is a good starting point since rss cache is marked old every 15 minutes minus 10 seconds.
  Example:
  
	*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php-cgi -q /var/www/torrentwatch-x/rss_dl.php -D >/dev/null 2>&1

- When using Transmission, please make sure that you have enabled remote management (web server).


You're done! now go to the url corresponding with your webserver/vhost config.
