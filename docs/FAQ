Q: TorrentWatch?-X just fetched an episode but it's shown as "Old Episode". Why?
A: the cache directory (rss_cache) is not writeable for the user running the web server. No cache history can be checked so     TorrentWatch?-X can't know whether it downloaded this file before.

Q: How to add feeds which only support cookies?
A:  First you will have to find the cookies containing the uid and password:
    - IE users will find their cookies in %UserProfile%\Cookies
    - Firefox users will find their cookies in Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> Show Cookies
    - Opera users will find their cookies in Tools -> Advanced -> Cookies
    - Users of other browsers will have to consult their browser's documentation
    
    The syntax used for feeds with cookies is:
    http://<feed_url>:COOKIE:<cookie1>=<value1>&<cookie2>=<value2>&<cookie3>.....)
    or:
    http://<feed_url>:COOKIE:<cookie1>=<value1>;<cookie2>=<value2>;<cookie3>.....)
