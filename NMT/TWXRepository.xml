      <Changelog>
	0.8.8

	* Updated jquery to 1.7.1
	* Fixed issue where ratio limit where not passed correctly to transmission.
	* Fixed issue where rss feeds with magnet links would not be added to transmission.
	* Better hidelist handling.

	0.8.6

	* Fixed issue that caused the config-cache to corrupt. Causing errors Like: cache_dir: ""  does not exist / have the wrong rights.
	* Moved web files to 'web' directory. I've included a cleanup.sh script to remove old files after updating. Make sure you backup config.php and move it to 'web/php' (or create a new one).
	* Replaced first run wizzard with default config.
	* Fixed a number of smaller bugs.

	0.8.4:

	* Fixed issue where twx-poller won't run when busybox is not installed on NMT. This caused auto-starting not to work.
	* Fixed issue that caused the config cache not to be cleared when config was changed.
	* Better mobile support.
	* Updated to jquery 1.7
	* Updated to PHPMailer 5.2.0
	* Moved to direct smtp mailing instead of using mail binary
	* Small css updates.

	0.8.2:

        * Moved from cron to a poller script on NMT. This because some NMT apps empty cron on install.
        * Added locking on config so config won't be erased if disk is full.
        * Added configfile caching for performance boost.
        * Fixed compat with transmission 2.4x
        * Better support for android and IOS devices.
	* Fixed issue where hiding a batch of shows would only hide half.
	* Fixed issue where adding a batch of shows as favorites would only add half.
   
	0.8.1: 

	* Updated css and javascript for mobile device support.
	* Upgraded to jquery 1.6.2
	* Fixed issue where install on NMT fails. (this actualy means tarring on linux, not bsd...)

	0.8.0:

	* Disabled ssl checking so https feeds with non-official certs work as well.
	* Added "Show Only" option that filters items with no episode info.
	* Updated look of the item list.
	* Added mobile support (Android, IOS).
