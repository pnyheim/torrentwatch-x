	    -- Fixed issue with proper episodes not being saved in Season dir when using Title + Season deep directories.
	    -- Added mailserver field in wizard.
	    -- Really fixed php 5.3.x problems.
	    -- Fixed issue where Favorite feed URLs did not get updated when updating a feed link
	    -- Fixed issue that caused bug reporting to fail.
	    -- Fixed issue with feeds that had to links in the feed, where the 2nd link was the torrent which would not be picked up by tw-x. (Thanks Allan Mørk Christensen)
	    -- Added curl_getinfo support in curl.php. (Thanks Allan Mørk Christensen)
	    -- Fixed issue that caused an error while trying to mail while no email address was filled in. Also moved the default email msg to a template file. (Thanks Allan Mørk Christensen)
	    -- Added negative caching for feeds that are down. This can mean that it takes up to 15 minutes, after thee feed comes back up, for the feed to be working again.
	    -- Fixed date matching issue where the format "Y-M-D" was not matched correctly.
	    -- Updated guessing routine for even better episode guessing :)
	    -- Fixed ui bug that caused hidden feeds the be shown in some cases.
	    -- Fixed an issue where Deep Directories did not work when using custom directories for favorites.
	   -- Fixed issue where bug reporting would always give a possitive message even if sending the report failed.
	    -- Added feature to guess for best link when multiple links are available in the feed. (Thanks Allan Mørk Christensen)
	    -- Added feature to detect when a link is not a torrent-file, but e.g. (x)html, and then look for a torrent link in that content. (Thanks Allan Mørk Christensen)
	    -- Better hidelist matching. 
	    -- WebUI will update rss cache if cache is older then 24 hours. The crontab script updates if cache is older then 15 minutes. This ensures the WebUI won't slow down when feeds are down or slow.
